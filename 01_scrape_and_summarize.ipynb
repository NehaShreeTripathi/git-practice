As part of the coalition agreement, though, the LkSG was to be replaced with the EU’s\\xa0CSDDD law.\\nIn response to a question regarding the apparent contradiction between the Chancellor’s comments and his commitment under the coalition agreement, Kornelius said that in addition to eliminating the LkSG, the coalition aims to “de-bureaucratize the European framework in line with the Commission President’s proposals in the Omnibus Act,” adding that the coalition is currently working on proposals to that end with the Commission.\\nWhile not specifying the proposed changes to the CSDDD, Kornelius added:\\n“As part of the EU Commission’s reform efforts to streamline bureaucracy, the aim is also to streamline the European Supply Chain Directive in its comprehensive impact.”\\nJoin our mailing list\\xa0for the latest breaking ESG investment news!\\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsR & DProcurement & ContractingSupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityStrategyTechnologyOther\\nJoin\\xa0the ESG Today daily newsletter and get all the top ESG stories, like this one.\\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsProcurement & ContractingR & DStrategySupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityTechnologyOther'"
